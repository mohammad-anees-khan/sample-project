# sample-project
This is my first GitHub repository.
<br>
git clone repoLink
<br>
make the changes locally
<br>
once done, add the changes using git add filename, or simply git add .
<br>
once added, now commit the changes using git commit -m "Your Message Here"
<br>
once committed, push the changes to the repo by executing git push origin main
<br>
git push is a general command to push the changes. origin means the repo from where it has originally been cloned and main means the main branch
<br>
git init: used to initialize the git for a local repo, in other words to make a local repo a git repo.
<br>
So a typical git workflow would be as:
<br>
1. Clone the repo
2. Make the changes
3. Add the changes
4. Commit the changes
5. push the changes
