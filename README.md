# sample-project
This is my first GitHub repository.
<br>
To clone the repo: 'git clone repoLink'
<br>
make the changes locally
<br>
once done, add the changes using 'git add fileName', or simply 'git add .'
<br>
once added, now commit the changes using 'git commit -m "Your Message Here"'
<br>
once committed, push the changes to the repo by executing 'git push origin main'
<br>
git push is a general command to push the changes. origin means the repo from where it has originally been cloned and main means the main branch
<br>
To used to initialize the git for a local repo, in other words to make a local repo a git repo, use 'git init'
<br>
So a typical git workflow would be as:
<br>
1. Clone the repo
2. Make the branch by executing "git checkout -b branchName"
3. Make and add the changes
4. Commit the changes
5. push the changes by git push origin branchName
<br>
It will have the pull request created in github which you need to review later to merge it with the master/main branch.
<br>
git diff main is used to compare the changes of newBranch with the main branch
<br>
checkout to main branch and finally merge using git merge newBranchName followed by ''git push origin main'
<br>
>> To delete a branch, use 'git branch -d branchName'
